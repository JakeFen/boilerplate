## This repository is a boilerplate for quickly spinning up a development environment using browsersync, scss, and es6.

## The gulpfile used is primarily for compiling es6 (through babel:es2015), scss -> css, and image minification

## Initially to spin up your local server, you will need to run:

`gulp browser-sync`

## Once your server has appeared in your browser, you can now run:

`gulp watch`

## The watch command will compile all your scss, js, and images into the dist folder of your assets. Your browser should reload with the changes you made.
